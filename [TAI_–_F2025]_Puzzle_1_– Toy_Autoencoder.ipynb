        "This notebook contains boilerplate Python code for initializing a multilayer perceptron and training it to remove noise from a batch of data. Below the code that defines the `nn.Module` is some very minimal optimization code. We initialize the neural network and train it to minimize the reconstruction error between `x` and `y`. Since the training set is very small (10 inputs, each a vector of length 5) even this small neural network should be able to perfectly fit the data. This means that the loss should be close to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, something is wrongâ€“Â if you run the code, you'll notice the loss stagnates; it won't drop below `0.3` or so. This indicates to us that there must be an error somewhere. This pattern of \"failing silently\" is very common in deep learning systems code. There isn't a compilation or runtime error; in fact, the code *looks right*, at least at first glance, but something is clearly amiss.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what's gone wrong? Maybe it's an optimization bug, or a problem with the data, or problem with our nn.Module. This is the tricky part about debugging these systems: we have to understand all the components and how they interact so that we might locate the one or two lines of code that aren't quite right. Spend the next few minutes exploring the code and talking to your classmates â€“ see if you can find and fix the bug. You'll know it's working if you can get a loss close to zero (say, less than 0.001)."
